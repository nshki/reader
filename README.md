Reader
======

An RSS reader that saves your feed sources to your device via localStorage. No login, just enter your feeds and read away.

I started this project to mainly scratch my own itch of not wanting to sign up for yet another service to consume my content.


## Live App

https://rss-reader.netlify.com/


## Tech Used

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Redux Zero](https://github.com/concretesolutions/redux-zero)
- [rss-parser](https://github.com/bobby-brennan/rss-parser)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)


## Setup

This app is made with create-react-app, so all default Yarn commands work.

- `yarn start` to start a dev server
- `yarn build` to build a production-ready app
